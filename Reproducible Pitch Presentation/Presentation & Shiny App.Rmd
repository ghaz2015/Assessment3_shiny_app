**Overview**
This is part 3 of assesment for the course Developing Data Products "Data Science Specialization."

Source code for ui.R and server.R files are available on the GitHub repo: https://github.com/ghaz2015/Assessment3_shiny_app/tree/master


## **Web Application functionality**
This App will provid the best tools for selecting car for trip.

It will requir you to provide trip details, like the distance of the trip and the cost of the petrol base of the area.

It will need to calculate the petrol expenditure for each car. 
The next step will provide your budget on the petrol.

We can filter and type of cars with Miles Per Gallon (MPG) Which will be below the budget.

**Part 2**
Will give you list of desire cars in term of:
- Cylinders
- Displacement
- Horse Power
- Transmission

## **MTCARS Dataset**
The data has used in this APP has come from the Motor Trend Car Road Tests (MTCARS) dataset. Below the mtcars's summary.

      mpg             cyl             disp             hp

The relationship between miles per gallon (mpg) and displacement (disp) in the mtcars dataset.

## **Plot**
In this graph will show the relationship between miles per gallon (mpg) and displacement (disp) in the mtcars dataset.
